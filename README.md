# Algorithm-Run-Time-Complexity

- **Project explanation:** 
  - We aim to create an online web application which emphasizes an interesting presentation to appeal to students, interactivity, and understandable feedback. This webpage will allow teachers to upload programs/code snippets. The teachers will then go on to annotate line by line the time complexity of each program. Students will then go in and annotate the programs. The students' annotations will be compared with the teachers' annotations and feedback will be provided on which lines the student has annotated incorrectly.

- **Release notes:**
  - **Milestone 1 (3/1/2023)**
    - Created frontend Angular application
    - Created backend Spring application
    - Created a UI that shows where the Teacher will login, and how students will find or search for problems 
    - Created a Problem Service to handle CRUD operations for Problems
    - Added in frontend tests for UI components

- **Additional branches:**
  - `student-problem-search-component` - This branch contains features that have not been merged, however, everything planned and developed for Milestone 1 is on `main`.
